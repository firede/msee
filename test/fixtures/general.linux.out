This is a test document it contains a lot of text that should be wrapped to
multiple lines.
日本語のテキストも書いてあります。どうしてかというと漢字はコンソールで二つの半角
のスペースを使っています。

[37m[39mWe also make sure that there is inline [3mitalic[23m and [1mbold[22m text. Maybe even [3m[1mbold
italic[22m[23m text? And how about [37mcode[39m or [1m[37mbold code[39m[22m or [3m[1m[37mbold italic code[39m[22m[23m? Maybe we need
some [1mbold[22m statements written with [3mitalic[23m letters? or [37m**bold code**[39m that is
processed other wise? © Should become © or shouldn't it? Multiple spaces like
here   should turn into a single space    even with a tab. To ensure a space we
can still use   , can't we?

This is a test document it contains a lot of text that should be wrapped to
multiple lines.

italic[22m[23m text? And how about [90mcode[39m or [1m[90mbold code[39m[22m or [3m[1m[90mbold italic code[39m[22m[23m? Maybe we need
some [1mbold[22m statements written with [3mitalic[23m letters? or [90m**bold code**[39m that is
processed other wise? &copy; Should become ¬© or shouldn't it? Multiple spaces
like here   should turn into a single space    even with a tab. To ensure a
space we can still use &nbsp;&nbsp;, can't we?

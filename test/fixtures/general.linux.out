some [1mbold[22m statements written with [3mitalic[23m letters? or [37m**bold code**[39m that is
processed other wise? &copy; Should become ¬© or shouldn't it? Multiple spaces
like here   should turn into a single space    even with a tab. To ensure a
space we can still use &nbsp;&nbsp;, can't we?
